## Building

Requires [ufbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt).

```sh
ufbt          # build only
ufbt launch   # build + deploy via USB
```

## IR Signals

Raw IR signals are in `Polk_MagnifiMini.ir` (NECext protocol, address `0xC8 0x91`). This file can be used directly with the Flipper Zero built-in IR app if you prefer a simpler remote without the custom UI.

## Compatibility

Tested with the **Polk MagnifiMini** soundbar (model MagnifiMini). May work with other Polk MagnifiMini variants that share the same IR protocol.
